  "description" : "h4. Brief description\n  Support the internal process to *maintain* machines (pumps, molding presses, drilling machine, engines, etc.) and/or means of productions (pressing tool, etc.) on a regular basis (maintainance) or an emergency basis.\nh4. Current system behaviour\n  * scheduling is not consideration maintenance time for machine groups automatically (must be done manually)\n  * scheduling does not consider the required time for means of production\n  * there is not enough guidelines in abas ERP to accomplish\n  ** planning future maintenance time for machines and/or means of production\n  ** requesting the maintenance internally (internal production) or request an external vendor\nh4. Requirement description\n  # Create a possibility for managing maintenance of machine groups and/or means of production\n  ## provide planning layer for future maintenance\n  ## provide a planning structure based on operating hours, amount of kilometers, press counter, etc.)\n  # create an alerting feature which helps a user to identify that a machine group must be maintained (e.g. via a business app)\n  # Allow handling machine groups and means of productions similar as service products\n  ## create a service request\n  ## create a repair order (if the machine group can be maintained internally)\n  ## create a purchase order (if the machine group must be maintained externally)\nh4.Maintenance pattern example\n  There should be an functionaly established which supports regular maintenance activities for service products. For internal planning this feature should support a service scheduler/planer in order to allocate technicians to maintenance reservations. This regular maintenance activities could be\n  * 1 maintenance every X months,\n  * 1 maintenance every x use of a mean of production,\n  * 1 maintenance every x hours of time declared on a machine,\n  * manual planning for these actions.\n  ",
